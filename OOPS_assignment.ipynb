        "ans :  Here are the 5 key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\n",
        "\n",
        "#### *1. Encapsulation* -\n",
        "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class. This helps to hide the implementation details of the class from the outside world and provides a way to control access to the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### *2. Abstraction* -\n",
        "Abstraction is the concept of showing only the necessary details of an object or system to the outside world, while hiding the internal implementation details. This helps to reduce complexity and improve modularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### *3. Inheritance* -\n",
        "Inheritance is the concept of creating a new class based on an existing class. The new class inherits the properties and methods of the existing class and can also add new properties and methods or override the ones inherited from the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### *4. Polymorphism* -\n",
        "Polymorphism is the concept of an object or method taking on multiple forms, depending on the context in which it is used. This can be achieved through method overloading or method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### *5. Composition* -\n",
        "Composition is the concept of creating objects from other objects or collections of objects. This helps to create complex objects from simpler ones and promotes code reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "These 5 key concepts of OOP provide a foundation for designing and developing robust, scalable, and maintainable software systems."

        "    - List the parents of the current class in the order they are defined.\n",

        "3. Python continues this process until it reaches the top of the inheritance graph (in this case, A).\n",
        "4. Once the MRO list is created, Python searches for the method in each class in the list, from left to right.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our example, the MRO list for class D would be:\n",

        "[D, B, C, A, object]\n",
